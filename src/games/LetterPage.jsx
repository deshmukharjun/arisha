Mala mahitiye its a bit redundant, but hey, you said yes, and that made it the best day of my life.\n\nThose first few years in school were just too cute, right? Then COVID hit, and things got tough, we were so far apart. But apan teva pan bhetlo, we made it through, and that's something I absolutely cherish about us.\n\nMala tu khup awadtes! Seriously, your passion for languages, especially French, is just... wow. When you speak French, tu khupach hot dises, Mau! And seeing you teach those little kids now, I can totally picture you as the most amazing, radiant, sunshine-like mom to our future kids. It's a thought that fills my heart with so much warmth.\n\nYou know, the way you treat me, the way you make me feel... it's just the best. I love the version of me that I am when I'm with you. We've literally grown up together, from being little dorks in school to figuring out life, side-by-side. Our connection, apan ekmekansathi banlo aahot feels so natural. Connections varun athavla kasa vatla tula game?

It's been an incredible journey, and you're my best friend, majhi soulmate. You are my EVERYTHING!\n\ni I43 you always!\n\nLoads of love,\nJunu`;
